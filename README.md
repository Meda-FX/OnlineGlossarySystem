Online Glossary System For SAIT


<h2> Project Overview </h2>
<h4>Statement of the Problem</h4>
As SAIT has a very diverse population of Students, there are some Students having difficulties
with the English language. An online glossary application is needed to help those Students
understanding terms used by their Instructors in various courses and contexts.

<h4>Project Scope</h4>
The system provides functionalities based on pre-defined role of Users. All Users can search for
specific terms and obtain both the dictionary definitions and Instructor definitions relevant to
their courses and Instructors. Instructors can add new definitions to existing terms and create
new terms if said term does not already exist. Admin can register User accounts and edit account
of different Users. Editors can confirm newly added terms and/or definitions, in addition to
editing and removing existing definitions.

<h4>System Environment</h4>
The system may be integrated into SAIT Brightspace online system as a widget, the system then
will be hosted on a server running Windows Server 2008 R2. The project will be developed as a
web application with responsive web frontend.

<h4>Functional Requirements by Actors</h4>
Instructor is the registered User who is going to add terms and definitions to the system so that
the Student can view the terms and definitions online. Instructor is also allow to edit/delete the
definition created by himself/herself.<br>
Student is the User who will launch the application from Brightspace and search for terms and
definition relevant to their courses.<br>
Admin is the User who will manage the application of a higher level, such as confirming
Instructorâ€™s registrations and registering all the account.<br>
The Editors will have a list of unreviewed terms and definitions to go through and curate. The
Editors also have the authority to view and edit any terms or definitions in the database. The
main role of the Editor is to review all submitted terms and make sure they are grammatically
correct, cited properly, are in the right categories and have valid definitions.
